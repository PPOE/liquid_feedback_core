Setup the database:
$ createdb liquid_feedback
$ psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f core.sql liquid_feedback

Optionally insert demo data:
$ psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f demo.sql liquid_feedback

Compile lf_update binary:
$ make

If you wish, copy the created lf_update file to /usr/local/bin or a
similar directory. Ensure that "lf_update dbname=liquid_feedback"
is called regularly. On successful run, lf_update will not produce
any output and exit with code 0.

NOTE: When writing to the database, some INSERTs must be executed
      within the same transaction, e.g. issues can't exist without
      an initiative and vice versa.

To uninstall the software, delete the lf_update binary
and drop the database by entering the following command:
$ dropdb liquid_feedback
